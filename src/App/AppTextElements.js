  purpose: 'If you\'re reading this, then you must be looking for something...anything...to fight off the isolation. You want a connection, a real connection with another human soul. The contents of this site will NOT help you connect with another person. Not directly, anyway. Connection is a two-way street, which means you\'ll need to be vulnerable... and long periods of loneliness can make it very difficult to be vulnerable. What this site CAN help you do, however, is open up the door to POSSIBLE connections. The learning contained within this place will allow you to more easily meet and get to know other people, but the choice to be vulnerable and attempt a true connection is ultimately up to you (and them, for that matter). That all being said, I personally think you\'re on the right track if you\'re here and ready to learn, because even though these methods can only open the door (technically speaking), they\'re REALLY REALLY GOOD AT DOING THAT.',

  learningCenter: 'Clicking on the LEARNING CENTER tab will take you to a short-ish guide detailing all you\'ll need to know to begin asking powerful, open-ended questions. The LEARNING CENTER is an excellent place to visit first, even if you\'re already familiar with open-ended questions. It\'s worth the read.',

  quizCenter: 'Here you wil find a quiz (of sorts) designed to make the use of open-ended questions more effortless and natural. You will be presented with a number of questions, and are expected to select all that are open-ended (or none, if all are closed-ended) before submitting your answer. That\'s the long and short of it, go take it for a test drive and see how you do!'
